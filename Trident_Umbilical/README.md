## Important Note:

**This mod has been tested on Trident 300 and 350 builds. Should work on 250 as well!**. 

## Changelog
10.09.2023.
Initial Release

## Why?

All my printer eventually had broken wire in drag chains issues after some 6-10k hours of printing, switching to umbilical solved the issue. All my printers use traditional umbilical, no CAN boards.

## Print Setup

All parts are printed without supports. Recommended material is ABS/ASA. Recommended perimeter count is 4 and 5 top/bottom layers with infil from 30%+. All parts in STL already have correct orientation, just import and print.

STL File naming:
- ..._x2_.stl simply means you need to print 2 parts - per VORON standards
